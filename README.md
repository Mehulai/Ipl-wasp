# Ipl-wasp
win and score predictor for ipl using numpy , pandas and matplotlib . We have 2 programs for one for predicting score and one for predicting the result . The result predictor code will take input of all the various factors involved in a match between 2 particular teams of a season such as toss winner , toss decision , venue , margin of runs/wickets of a particular win , umpires etc to predict the odds of a team winning a particular match on a particular venue. 
The score predictin code will take input of all the deliveries of all the matches held from the starting till the date and will use machine learning algorithm to predict the score of a particular innings based on that.

Installation :-
#Getting Started

Prerequisites

The Code inside the nptebooks is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.

To install pip run in the command Line

python -m ensurepip -- default-pip

to upgrade it

python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel

to upgrade Python

pip install python -- upgrade

You will also need to download the Numpy, Pandas and MatplotLib packages. Again in the command Line type

pip install numpy 
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib

to download them using pip or

conda install numpy pandas matplotlib 

and type Yes when asked to to download them using Anaconda.
## GENERAL RULES:-
1) Don't commit directly, make another branch and put a pull request, we will verify and add the code to the repository
2) The repository is under Apache Licence 2.0
